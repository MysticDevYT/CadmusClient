# Cadmus Client
A small utility client I'm making in my spare time for Minecraft 1.12.2

Intended for anarchy. However, not really intended for PVP, however I have put some basic Combat modules in it
such as KillAura and AutoTotem. The CrystalAura is the worst CA you will ever see.

Total amount of modules: 36

List of Commands:

Default prefix: .

- Toggle [Syntax: toggle <name>]
- Bind   [Syntax: b <name> <key> | clear <name>]
- Help   [Syntax: help]
- Gui    [Syntax: gui scale <val> | reset]
- Friend [Syntax: fr <add | remove> <name>]                       // IN BETA, DO NOT RELY ON IT TO WORK
- Prefix [Syntax: prefix <prefix>]
- Color  [Syntax: color <color> <value> | color preset <color>]  // TRY INGAME FOR LIST OF COLOURS
