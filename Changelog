-0.0.7 [PATCH 1]-
- Fixed a bug where it would show a scrapped-but-not-deleted feature. (Custom main menu that I gave up on cause it looked shit)

-0.0.7-
- Added PlayerAimbot, EntityAimbot, AirJump, AutoWalk, ClientName, Step, and Jetpack.
- Added module state saving. So you don't have to re-enable the modules each time you load up the client.
- Hovering over modules in the ClickGUI now shows what they do at the top of the screen.
- All of this took about 12 hours of coding. Support would be greatly appreciated.

-0.0.6-
- Added Tracers and a ClickGUI
- Tracers - Draws a line to all entities, Green for passive / animals, Red for mobs / enemies, Cyan for players.
- ClickGUI - Open with right shift, click on modules to toggle them.

-0.0.5-
- Added MobESP, PlayerESP, ChestESP, CoordsHUD and OmniSprint as a seperate hack.
- OmniSprint - Sprint in all directions. Hoping to add this as a mode of Sprint, and combine them. (Can trigger anticheats - use with caution)
- Improved Fly
- Sprint now only sprints when you walk forward, in an attempt to not trigger any anticheats.
- Added a helpers list on the main menu. If you help me with the client, your name will be added there.

-0.0.4-
- Added Kill Aura

-v0.0.3-
- Third release
- Decided to switch to MCP
- Added No Fall, Sprint, Fullbright, Suicide and a TabGUI.
- TabGUI - Lets you toggle modules without a keybind. Still kinda in progress.
- Better modules list.
- When installing, it doesn't currently make a new installation, you have to do that yourself. If you need help with that, I suggest going to a mental health department.

-v0.0.2-
- Second Release
- The Fly hack now works - Press 'F' to turn it on
- Sprint has temporarily been removed

-v0.0.1-
- First Release
- Nothing really does anything
- but RAINBOWS and RGB TEXT
- Press F for Flight and M for Sprint (neither do anything yet)
