-0.0.5-
- Added MobESP, PlayerESP, ChestESP, CoordsHUD and OmniSprint as a seperate hack.
- OmniSprint - Sprint in all directions. Hoping to add this as a mode of Sprint, and combine them. (Can trigger anticheats - use with caution)
- Improved Fly
- Sprint now only sprints when you walk forward, in an attempt to not trigger any anticheats.
- Added a helpers list on the main menu. If you help me with the client, your name will be added there.

-0.0.4-
- Added Kill Aura

-v0.0.3-
- Third release
- Decided to switch to MCP
- Added No Fall, Sprint, Fullbright, Suicide and a TabGUI.
- TabGUI - Lets you toggle modules without a keybind. Still kinda in progress.
- Better modules list.
- When installing, it doesn't currently make a new installation, you have to do that yourself. If you need help with that, I suggest going to a mental health department.

- The Fly hack now works - Press 'F' to turn it on
- Sprint has temporarily been removed

-v0.0.1-
- First Release
- Nothing really does anything
