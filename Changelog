-v0.0.3-
- Third release
- Decided to switch to MCP
- Added No Fall, Sprint, Fullbright, Suicide and a TabGUI.
- TabGUI - Lets you toggle modules without a keybind. Still kinda in progress.
- Better modules list.
- When installing, it doesn't currently make a new installation, you have to do that yourself. If you need help with that, I suggest going to a mental health department.

-v0.0.2-
- Second Release
- The Fly hack now works - Press 'F' to turn it on
- Sprint has temporarily been removed

-v0.0.1-
- First Release
- Nothing really does anything
- but RAINBOWS and RGB TEXT
- Press F for Flight and M for Sprint (neither do anything yet)
